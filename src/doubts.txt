Doubts:
1. Why are emails not matching with customers?


Assumptions:
1. SendId is the marketing campaign identifier
2. If the trx is repeated (same card membership id, same transaction date, same function date), it is an add on, so we will agg
3. BOLETOS that are negative are type error, only positive are valid
4. The first email is the one with the effect

Questions:
1. Does all the movies had a trx?
2. How many users didn't have any transaction?

"Tricks":
Can cap the sales up to 12 tickets per transaction, as T&C says that is the maximum allowed.
Will cap the info until mid july, because the dataset looks bad after that date
Will use the first email for each user, as there is 1.05 emails per user; this will help me for accounting the effect in each campaign

Filters:
1. Only users with trx and email recieved
2. The email used will be the first one
